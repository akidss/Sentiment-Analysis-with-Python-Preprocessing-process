# Sentiment Analysis Data Preprocessing

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts for preprocessing textual data, specifically tailored for sentiment analysis tasks. By preparing the data with effective cleaning and transformation techniques, this code ensures high-quality input for machine learning models.

## Features
- **Text Cleaning**: Removes noise, such as special characters, numbers, and URLs.
- **Stopword Removal**: Filters out non-informative words, focusing on meaningful content.
- **Lemmatization/Stemming**: Converts words into their base or root forms for consistency.
- **Tokenization**: Splits sentences into individual words for analysis.
- **Vectorization**: Transforms text into numerical representations using methods like TF-IDF or Word2Vec.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset in `.csv` or `.txt` format with the text data.
2. Update the file path in the script to point to your dataset.
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
4. The cleaned and preprocessed data will be saved as a new file or ready for further analysis.

## Example Workflow
1. Load the raw dataset:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')
   ```
2. Apply preprocessing functions from the script:
   ```python
   from preprocess import preprocess_text
   data['cleaned_text'] = data['raw_text'].apply(preprocess_text)
   ```
3. Save the processed data:
   ```python
   data.to_csv('cleaned_dataset.csv', index=False)
   ```
